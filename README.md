# stats-notebooks
Notes and interactive visualizations for some topics in probability and statistics

## Introduction
Hi! As someone who's taught a lot of math classes, I've found that the best way to understand something is often to explain it to someone else. These notes are my attempt to do that for a few things I'm trying to learn related to probability, statistics, and machine learning. Everything here should be thought of as "always in progress" (though please write or submit a PR if you find a mistake).

## Usage
These run on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Assuming you have a working Python:
1. Clone the repo,
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`,
3. `jupyter notebook`.
This should open a browser tab where you can see the directory. Click on a notebook file to open it. Use Shift+Enter to run a cell with Python code. For more information, see the [Jupyter documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/)
